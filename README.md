<h1> Sleep Disorder Prediction</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
Developed an intelligent model leveraging machine learning techniques to predict chronic insomnia, a prevalent sleep disorder exacerbated by modern lifestyle changes. The project addressed the need for an accessible, cost-effective, and time-efficient diagnostic tool, particularly beneficial for regions with limited access to expensive medical tests and equipment. Employed five different machine learning classifiers to analyze various internal sleep factors and optimize prediction accuracy, providing a robust alternative to traditional medical testing methods.
